# MyArduinoProjects

In December 2021, I bought a
[SparkFun Inventor's Kit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41)
from
[You-Do-It Electronics](https://www.youdoitelectronics.com/).
Initially, this repository holds my own
modifications based on the projects from that kit.  I expect I'll
be doing other small Arduino projects which could appear here as
well.
